# 🐼🔥 Pandas vs FireDucks — Performance Showdown on Real Data

This project benchmarks two powerful data processing libraries — **Pandas** and **FireDucks** — using a structured dataset to evaluate their performance in handling typical data engineering tasks.

We applied real-world data operations on a **Wine Reviews** dataset to compare execution times and understand where FireDucks gives a speed boost.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is designed to demonstrate how **FireDucks** performs significantly better than traditional **Pandas** when working with large-scale datasets.

Through real-world benchmarking, it highlights:

- 🔥 FireDucks' ability to efficiently process big data
- 🐼 The limitations of Pandas with memory and execution time
- ⚡ Faster execution of key operations like GroupBy, Filtering, and Sorting
- 📊 How FireDucks enables scalable data workflows

Perfect for **Data Engineers**, **Analysts**, or anyone handling large volumes of data and curious about performance differences between data processing tools.
